The MemPool project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for a simulated Cortex-M3 device

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  12 MHz
   - Core    =  12 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example shows the issue with 
freeing the memory two times. After double free, if we 
invoke the allocate, it keep on allocating the same buffer 
again and again.

The MemPool example program is available for one target:

  Simulation:          configured for a simulated on-chip Flash
